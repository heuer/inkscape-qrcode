This project is not maintained anymore and does not work with Inkscape 1.0 
==========================================================================

If someone wants to maintain this project I'd be happy to transfer it together with the `PyPI project <https://pypi.org/project/inkscape-qrcode/>`_



QR Code generator for Inkscape
==============================

While Inkscape provides a QR Code generator, this extension provides slightly
more options (i.e. generation of Micro QR Codes and an optimal error correction
level) and should be standard-conform.

This Inkscape extension includes `Segno <https://github.com/heuer/segno/>`_, a
BSD-licensed, pure Python library which implements the ``ISO/IEC 18004:2015(E)``
standard for QR Codes.


Installation
------------

Use ``pip`` to install inkscape-qrcode from PyPI::

    $ pip install --update --target=<target_dir> inkscape-qrcode

``<target_dir>`` should refer to an absolute path, see below for typical
installation directories.

Alternatively copy the ``inkscape_qrcode.inx`` and the ``inkscape_qrcode``
directory into the target directoy.

The QR Code generator should appear in the menu
``Extensions > Render > Barcode > QR Code (Segno)``
